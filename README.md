### Coding Challenges

The coding challenges featured in L33tClone draw inspiration from LeetCode, a well-known platform for honing programming skills. These challenges have been manually entered into the Firebase database, enabling users to access and solve a wide variety of problems.

Some of these challenges are closely linked to Firebase, offering a dynamic and interactive learning experience.
